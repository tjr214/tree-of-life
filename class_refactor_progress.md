# TreeOfLife Class Refactoring Project Progress

## Phase 1: Setup and Planning

- [x] Review existing `new_tree.py` code
- [x] Define requirements for the `TreeOfLife` class
- [x] Create this task list document

## Phase 2: Basic Class Structure

- [ ] Create `TreeOfLife` class with constructor and basic attributes
- [ ] Define color scheme ENUMs
- [ ] Create data structures to store Sephiroth and Paths information
- [ ] Implement basic setup methods

## Phase 3: Color Scheme Implementation

- [ ] Parse color data from color scales
- [ ] Implement plain/default color scheme
- [ ] Implement `set_sephiroth_color_scheme` method
- [ ] Implement `set_path_color_scheme` method
- [ ] Create helper methods for specialized color effects (flecked, rayed, tinged)

## Phase 4: Rendering Implementation

- [ ] Implement base rendering logic
- [ ] Implement selective Sephirah rendering
- [ ] Create method to determine which paths to include when rendering a single Sephirah
- [ ] Implement logic to gray out connected Sephiroth
- [ ] Implement special color effects rendering

## Phase 5: Output Methods

- [ ] Implement method to display the tree in a window
- [ ] Implement method to save the tree to a file
- [ ] Create a combined method to both display and save

## Phase 6: Testing and Refinement

- [ ] Test full tree rendering with different color schemes
- [ ] Test selective Sephirah rendering
- [ ] Test special color effects
- [ ] Optimize and refine code
- [ ] Add detailed documentation

## Phase 7: Final Implementation

- [ ] Write example usage code
- [ ] Create demonstration script
- [ ] Final review and testing
- [ ] Integration with any existing systems

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add option for custom color schemes
- [ ] Add option to adjust size and spacing
- [ ] Add text labels for Sephiroth names
- [ ] Add support for Hebrew letter and astrological symbol display options
